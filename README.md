# Book Management Application

This is a Node.js/Express application for managing books. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on books and add them to their favorites list.

## Project Structure

- `app.js`: This is the main entry point of the application where the Express server is configured. It sets up middleware, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines routes for handling HTTP requests.

- `bookRoutes.js`: This file defines the routes related to book management using Express's Router. It includes endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting books.

- `Book.js`: This file contains the Mongoose schema and model definition for the Book object. It specifies the structure of book documents in the MongoDB database and provides methods for interacting with the Book collection.

- I just added a RESTful API for managing books, users, and reviews. It will provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books, as well as user authentication and review management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd book-management-app

Validation Middleware:
Implemented validation middleware using express-validator to ensure incoming request data is validated before processing.

Error Handling Middleware:
Added error handling middleware to handle errors that occur during request processing and send appropriate error responses back to the client.

Environment Configuration:
Utilized dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file for sensitive information like database URIs and JWT secrets.

User Registration Route:
Added a user registration route to allow users to sign up for the application, handling the creation of new user accounts in the database.

Logout Route:
Implemented a logout route to handle user logout functionality, especially useful when using sessions along with JWT authentication.

Additional Book Operations:
Included additional routes for book-related operations such as retrieving a single book and searching books, enhancing the functionality of the application.

Middleware Ordering:
Ensured correct ordering of middleware and route handlers to optimize request processing and maintain application behavior.

Error Logging:
Considered adding logging functionality using libraries like winston or morgan to log errors and important events occurring within the application.

Security Headers:
Implemented security headers using packages like helmet to enhance the security of the application and protect against common vulnerabilities.

Database Connection Error Handling:
Added error handling for database connection errors to handle scenarios where the application fails to connect to the MongoDB database.

Usage
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the server: npm start
Access the application via the specified endpoints to utilize the implemented functionalities.
