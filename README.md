# Book Management Application

This is a Node.js/Express application for managing books. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on books and add them to their favorites list.

## Project Structure

- `app.js`: This is the main entry point of the application where the Express server is configured. It sets up middleware, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines routes for handling HTTP requests.

- `bookRoutes.js`: This file defines the routes related to book management using Express's Router. It includes endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting books.

- `Book.js`: This file contains the Mongoose schema and model definition for the Book object. It specifies the structure of book documents in the MongoDB database and provides methods for interacting with the Book collection.

- I just added a RESTful API for managing books, users, and reviews. It will provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books, as well as user authentication and review management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd book-management-app
